Two joints activated on each leg. 
one at the hip and one at the knee.
The script for the third joint(ankle) is ready, but the joint has to be activated. 
The two legs currently cycle through two poses simultaneosly. 
The center of mass is maintined within the body no tuning done. 
The Hip joint forces are less and not that visible. Should they be made more visible ? I think so. 
The knee joint is what is is driving the simulation according to me. 
The angle of the knee joint is also too large I guess, the pit has to be upright. Currently its not. 
The puppetier mechanism hasn't been achived yet. 

Update 2 (Scene to be opened - bouncymovingmech)

All three joints activated. 
The Mech is still bouncy, the angles and forces have to tuned so that its not. 
The version of Unity used is 5.1.2
I think it will work with 5.2 too. But breaks down in 5.3
